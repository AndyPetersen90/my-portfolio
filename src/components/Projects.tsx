            This was my final project for DevMountain. This project was my first use of an API. The API allowed me to search for movie titles with a
            search function. I could then paginate if necessary. Additionally I designed this website to allow for storing a list of movies I already
            own, and movies I would like to own. <br />
            <br /> Currently it is down for updates and moving to a new hosting service.

            Helped build a static page for a former coworker. This is static page for a company that offers perminent lighting solutions for homes.
            This is designed with a few images of past work as well as a option for people to request quotes or request to partner to be a seller of
            the lights. Both of these forms use an AWS lamda function to send the requests to the company's email. This project was fun as I got to
            use Astro and practice building a static page with serverside and clientside rendering.

            memory by progressively removing the words to any song they are learning. This was a fun and quick project to build. I was able to play
            with custom fond sizing and global themes with Tailwind.

            In my church, I help lead the children in singing religious music. I built this quick little word fishing game. Its a simple game that is
            based on Hangman, but more kid friendly. When a letter is guessed and it is part of the word, the letter is shown in the word as well as
            the fist moves closer to the fisherman. This was a prett simple project, but it was fun to be able to work with animations and CSS to make
            it look nice.
